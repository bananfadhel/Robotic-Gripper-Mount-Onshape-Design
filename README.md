## Overview
This is a custom-designed robotic gripper mount created using Onshape. The component is designed to attach a robotic gripper to a base or robotic arm, with consideration for mounting strength, alignment, and motor integration.

## Features
- Designed in Onshape CAD.
- Mounting holes for motors or bolts.
- Curved inner surface for smooth operation.
- Symmetrical design for balanced load distribution.

## Use Case
This part can be used in:
- DIY robotic arms.
- Educational robotics kits.
- Light-duty automation prototypes.
